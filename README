One2One2Go USB Drive Image
Version 1.4 (Stable)
Last updated: 5/8/11

ABOUT:
This image was created for educational use in Somerville, MA. It includes Etoys, an interactive program primarily used to teach kids to write computer scripts, and a mobile version of Dropbox, an automatic backup application. Both of these are freeware downloads, and questions specifically about them should be directed to their respective websites.
The included Java applications were written by Derek Redfern.

INSTALLATION:
1. Copy all files to a fresh USB stick. (Omit this readme.) Make sure you copy them to the root of the drive for ease of use.
2. If you're running Windows, go to the next step. If not, Dropbox is not compatible with your system, so skip to "Use".
3. Run Setup.jar to set up your Dropbox account. Update the program if prompted. (NOTE: Setup.jar is hidden by default. If you don't know how to view hidden files, execute Etoys.jar instead. It'll still bring up the installation screen.)
4. A large config screen will appear. My recommendation is to change the folder to ".\Etoys" (the default is ".\Dropbox") and leave the other settings alone.
5. Go through the Dropbox setup and either login with your existing account or create a new one.
6. Setup should be complete and Dropbox should sync with the cloud.

USE:
Double-clicking on the Etoys.jar icon will execute Etoys on Linux, Windows, and Mac, and will additionally start Dropbox on Windows.

Note about Linux systems: You may not execute the jar from the command line on Linux.
