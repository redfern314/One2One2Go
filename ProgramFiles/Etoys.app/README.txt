USING ETOYS-TO-GO

The main purpose of Etoys-To-Go is for putting it on a USB thumb drive.  It
does not require to install anything on a machine's hard disk.  All the files
are in one directory, including the Etoys projects you save.  That makes it
easy to transport projects e.g. between home and school.

You can also drag Etoys-To-Go.app to your desktop and use it from there.
This is useful if, for example, your institution's policy does not allow to
install applications.  If you can, it still is better to use the installer
version because that will also install the Web Browser Plugin.  This enables
using Etoys projects on the web without having to download them.


ABOUT

The directory structure for packaging Squeak applications for multiple
platforms (such as Etoys-To-Go) was developed in 2006 by Bert Freudenberg
while working on impara's "Plopp" drawing tool for kids.  It won the 2006
ESUG Smalltalk Technology Innovation Award.  The trick is in (ab)-using
the Macintosh .app bundle structure by adding Virtual Machines for other
platforms like Windows and Linux.  The image and other files are shared
between all platforms.  Many Squeak applications are now packaged using
this format.  The community adopted the term "OneClick" for it.  The first
Etoys-To-Go was created for the Etoys 4.0 release in 2009.
